<h1> what is CatNap</h1>

<p>CatNap, otherwise known as Experiment 1188, is an upcoming major antagonist in Poppy Playtime, with his impending debut in Chapter 3: Deep Sleep leaving fans eager for his appearance.The events of the Smiling Critters Cartoon, one of many cartoons produced by Playtime Pictures, unfold on a stormy and windy night, evident by the dark and unsettled atmosphere. Inside the house, a clock reads 10:05 PM before switching to 10:06 PM. All of the Smiling Critters, except for CatNap, are huddled together in the living room, wrapped in blankets and wearing worried expressions. They engage in a conversation, discussing their fear of the howling wind. The tension increases as a tree branch snaps off, causing CraftyCorn to cower and seek shelter under her blanket. DogDay attempts to uplift the mood by reassuring everyone that everything will be okay. Suddenly, there is a knock on the door, with CatNap appearing on the other side. The critters' faces light up with relief as they all call out his name. They plead with CatNap to assist them in falling asleep. In response, CatNap spits a cloud of red gas from his mouth. The critters begin to laugh uncontrollably as the gas fills the cabin, with the laughter building in volume and amplification. Reaching a climax, the critters fall to the floor while CatNap sits alone on the couch, staring into the camera. With this chilling freeze-frame, the credits roll, acknowledging the producers and cast involved in the cartoon CatNap Recall, a news broadcast from WLE-4, covers reports of children in possession of CatNap toys suffering violent nightmares. The broadcast begins with the Smiling Critters Cartoon, before cutting to the news anchor introducing the Smiling Critters toy line to the audience. A demonstration of how CatNap's scent is deployed plays, before the anchor discusses the aforementioned controversy surrounding CatNap and subsequently, Playtime Co. itself. He mentions that Playtime Co. issued a recall of all CatNap toys from the lineup, resulting in his presence removed from all promotional material featuring the Smiling Critters. CatNap was designed specifically to protect Home Sweet Home in Playcare and put the children within to sleep. Rather than traditional internal organs, CatNap's inner systems are made of an unknown malleable material, granting him the ability to manipulate his appearance. CatNap can shrink down to the size of a typical cat or even as small as a rat. In one of the teasers for Chapter 3: Deep Sleep, CatNap is seen hiding inside a decaying body adorned with a Hazmat Suit The main purpose of CatNap, however, is to emit a clear lavender scented gas from its mouth whenever itâ€™s tail is pulled, but an unknown error in the doll's production line caused a red gas that, according to latter worker's notes, did not smell like lavender to emit from his mouth. This gas, showcased in the Smiling Critters Cartoon, is intended to help children fall asleep. Composed of various undisclosed ingredients, including the notorious Poppy flower, which was once utilized for soul transfers, CatNap can exhale this gas at will. Upon inhalation, anyone in its vicinity will lose consciousness. The effects of the gas, however, can be countered by wearing a Gas Mask. </p>
